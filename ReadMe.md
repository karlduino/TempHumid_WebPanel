## temperature/humidity web panel

Slightly modified version of Project 1 in "Arduino meets Linux" by Bob Hammell.

I'm using an
[RHT003 temperature/humidity sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167)
(equivalent to [DHT22 at Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/385))
rather than the
[MCP9808 temperature sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1782) that he used.
